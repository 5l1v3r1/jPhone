<center><h1>Location Update</h1></center><h3> A MS will need to update its location whenever it moves to a tower that is serviced by a different VLR then the one it is currently on. An MS c an move from BTS to BTS without ever telling the network, as long as it is within the same location area. Once it moves to a new location area, it is required to inform the network.</h3><table border = "0" cellspacing = "10"><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2"><h1><center>The MS moves to another Location Area</center></h1></td></tr><tr>	<td> 	As a MS moves around it is constantly monitoring the signal strength of the BCCH of its current BTS, as well as neighboring BTS's to determine if the neighbors have a stronger signal. When the MS is in idle mode (not in a call), it will determine for itself when to move from its current BTS to a more attractive one. When the MS switches from a BTS in one VLR to a BTS in a different VLR, it must do an location update, so the network knows which MSC/VLR the MS is currently using.	<BR><BR>	In the diagram on the right, we see two different <i>location areas</i> serviced by two different VLR's. The MS is currently sitting on BTS-2 in Location Area 1. As the MS moves towards the edge of the location area, it measures BTS-3 as being stronger and decides to switch to that BTS. Since BTS-3 is in another location area, it will need to do a location update.</td>	<td bgcolor = "gray"><center><img src = "images/Location Update 1.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2"><h1><center>Channel Request</center></h1></td></tr><tr>	<td>	Just like the IMSI Attach, and every other time the MS requests access, it goes through the same procedures. 	<br><br>	1. The MS requests a channel by sending a <i>Channel Request</i> (CHAN_REQ) message on the RACH. 	<br><br>	2. The BTS responds by sending an <i>Immediate Assignment Command</i> message (IMM_ASS_CMD) on the AGCH. 	<br><br>	3. The MS switches to the assigned SDCCH and replies with a <i>Location Update Request</i> (LOC_UPD_REQ). Included in the LOC_UPD_REQ is the TMSI the MS is currently using as well as the <i>Location Area Identifier</i> (LAI) of the VLR it is leaving. 	<br><br>	4. The BTS acknowledges receipt of the message.	</td>	<td bgcolor = "gray"><center><img src = "images/IMSI Attach 1.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2"><h1><center>Gaining VLR requests data from Losing VLR</center></h1></td></tr><tr>	<td>	5. The BSS forwards the Location Update Request to the gaining MSC/VLR.  	<br><br>	6. The gaining MSC/VLR does not recognize the TMSI/IMSI of the MS, so it contacts the losing MSC/VLR that corresponds to the LAI that was provided by the MS. The new MSC/VLR requests the subscriber data for the given TMSI.	<br><br>	7. The gaining MSC/VLR will then authenticate the MS. There are two ways this could occur. First, the losing MSC/VLR may have forwarded any sets of triplets that it was retaining for the MS. The gaining MSC/VLR would then just use the next set of triplets. Second, the gaining MSC/VLR could contact the HLR and request authentication triplets from the AuC and proceed with authentication that way.	<br>	<font size = "2"> The authentication and encryption process is not shown here. It occurs the same way as in the IMSI Attach. For more information, see the <a href = "../encryption/encryption.html">Encryption and Authentication Tutorial</a>.</font>	</td>	<td bgcolor = "gray"><center><img src = "images/Location Update 2.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2"><h1><center>Location Update</center></h1></td></tr><tr>	<td>	8. Once the MS has been authenticated and is in Cipher Mode, the MSC/VLR sends a Location Update Accept message (LOC_UPD_ACC) through the BSS to the MS. The LOC_UPD_ACC may have a TMSI assignment in it, otherwise the TMSI will be assigned in a TMSI_REAL_CMD message.	<br><br>	9. The MS will respond with a TMSI Reallocation Complete message (TMSI_REAL_COM) indicating it has received the TMSI.	<BR><BR>	10. The BSS then sends the MS a Channel Release message (CHAN_REL) instructing it to go into idle mode. The BSS then unassigns the SDCCH. As far as the MS is concerned, the location update has been completed.	</td>	<td bgcolor = "gray"><center><img src = "images/Location Update 3.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2"><h1><center>Updating the Registers</center></h1></td></tr><tr>	<td>	The Gaining MSC/VLR sends an <i>Update Location</i> message to the HLR. The HLR updates its records to point to the gaining MSC/VLR when it is asked for its location. It also passes on subscriber information for the MS to the gaining MSC/VLR.  	<br><br>	The HLR sends a <i>Cancel Location</i> message to the losing MSC/VLR. The losing MSC/VLR deletes the MS's record and also releases the TMSI for reassignment. The losing MSC/VLR sends a <i>Cancel Location Result</i> message back to the HLR, confirming the cancellation.	</td>		<td bgcolor = "gray"><center><img src = "images/Location Update 4.gif"></center></td></tr><tr><td colspan = "2" bgcolor = "gray"></td></tr></table>
