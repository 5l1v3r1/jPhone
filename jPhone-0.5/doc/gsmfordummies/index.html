Welcome to GSM For Dummies. This website is designed to help people gain a greater understanding of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). There are a number of tutorials on the website. I will continue to update the site with new material and new tutorials. If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions please feel free to <a href = "contact/contact.shtml">contact me</a>.
