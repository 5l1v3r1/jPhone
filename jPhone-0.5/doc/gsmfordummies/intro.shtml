<a name="intro"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>GSM is an acronym that stands for <b>Global System for Mobile Communications</b>. The original french acronym stands for <i>Groupe Sp&#233;cial Mobile</i>. It was originally developed in 1984 as a standard for a mobile telephone system that could be used across Europe.<br><br>GSM is now an international standard for mobile service. It offers high mobility. Subscribers can easily roam worldwide and access any GSM network. <br><br>GSM is a digital cellular network. At the time the standard was developed it offered much higher capacity than the current analog systems. It also allowed for a more optimal allocation of the radio spectrum, which therefore allows for a larger number of subscribers.<br><br>GSM offers a number of services including voice communications, Short Message Service (SMS), fax, voice mail, and other supplemental services such as call forwarding and caller ID.<br><br>Currently there are several bands in use in GSM. 450 MHz, 850 MHZ, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz are the most common ones.<br><br>Some bands also have <i>Extended GSM (EGSM)</i> bands added to them, increasing the amount of spectrum available for each band.<br><br>GSM makes use of Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA).<br>*TDMA will be discussed later<br><br>

<a name = "links"></a><h2>Uplinks/Downlinks & Reverse Forward</h2>GSM allows for use of duplex operation. Each band has a frequency range for the uplink (cell phone to tower) and a separate range for the downlink (tower to the cell phone). The uplink is also known as the <i>Reverse</i> and the downlink is also known as the <i>Forward</i>. In this tutorial, I will use the terms uplink and downlink.<br><br><center><img src="images/updown.jpg"><h3>Uplink and Downlink</h3></center><br><br>

<font size = "2"> <a href = "#top">[Back to Top]</a></font>
<br>
<hr width=100%>
<br>

<a name = "fdma"></a><h2>Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)</h2>GSM divides the allocated spectrum for each band up into individual carrier frequencies. Carrier separation is 200 khz. This is the FDMA aspect of GSM. 

<h3>Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN)</h3> The ARFCN is a number that describes a pair of frequencies, one uplink and one downlink. The uplink and downlink frequencies each have a bandwidth of 200 kHz. The uplink and downlink have a specific <i>offset</i> that varies for each band. The offset is the frequency separation of the uplink from the downlink. Every time the ARFCN increases, the uplink will increase by 200 khz and the downlink also increases by 200 khz.

<br><br>
An ARFCN has an allowed bandwidth of 200 kHz, which corresponds exactly to the carrier separation. The frequency of the ARFCN refers to its center frequency. If an ARFCN has a frequency of 914.80 MHz, then it occupies the frequency space from 914.7 MHz to 914.9 MHz (200 kHz total). Remember that this is the <i>allocated</i> bandwidth. Because of the nature of the modulation method (GMSK) and data rate used in GSM, the actual physical bandwidth will be about 135.4 kHz. The unused bandwidth for each ARFCN acts as a buffer between other ARFCN to avoid interference.

*Note: Although GSM operates in duplex (separate frequencies for transmit and receive), the mobile station does not transmit and receive at the same time. A switch is used to toggle the antenna between the transmitter and receiver.</font>

<br><br>The following table summarizes the frequency ranges, offsets, and ARFCNs for several popular bands.<br><br><center><img src = "images/bands.jpg"><h3>GSM Bands</h3></center><br><br>The following diagram illustrates an ARFCN with paired uplink and downlink frequencies for ARFCN 1 in the GSM 900 band.<br><br><center><img src="images/gsm900_arfcn1.jpg"><h3>GSM900 ARFCN 1</h3></center><br><br>

<br>

<a name = "calcfreqs"></a><h2>Calculating Uplink/Downlink Frequencies</h2>The following is a way to calculate the uplink and downlink frequencies for some of the bands, given the band, the ARFCN, and the offset.<br><br><h3>GSM 900</h3>Up = 890.0 + (ARFCN * .2) <br>Down = Up + 45.0<br><br>example: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the ARFCN 72, and we know the offset is 45MHz for the GSM900 band:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up = 890.0 + (72 * .2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up = 890.0 +   (14.4)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up = 904.40 MHz<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down = Up + Offset<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down = 904.40 + 45.0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down = 949.40 MHz<br><br>The uplink/downlink pair for GSM900 ARFCN72 is 904.40/949.40 (MHz)

<br><br>

Note that channel 0 (890.0 MHz) is used as a guard band in GSM-900 and is not usable for traffic. 

<br><br>Here are the formulas for EGSM900, DCS1800, and PCS1900:

<h3>EGSM900</h3>Up = 890.0 + (ARFCN * .2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ARFCN 0-124)<br> 
Up = 890.0 + ((ARFCN-1024)*0.2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ARFCN 975 - 1023)<br>
Down = Up + 45.0
<br><br>
<font color = "red">***Notice that the <i>extended</i> portion of the E-GSM band actually occurs below the regular band in frequency. ARFCN 974-1023 occur from 880.0 MHz to 889.80 MHz. The regular GSM (0-124) occurs from 890.0 MHz to 914.8 MHz. <br><br>

ARFCN 974 (880.0 MHZ) is used as a guard band and so is not usable for traffic. ARFCN 0 (890.0 MHz), which is used as a guard band in regular GSM-900, is available for use as a traffic channel in E-GSM since this channel happens to be in the middle of this band and a guard channel is not necessary there. 
</font>

<br><br>
<h3>DCS1800</h3>Up = 1710.0 + ((ARFCN - 511) * .2) <br> 
Down = Up + 95.0
<br><br>
<h3>PCS1900</h3>Up = 1850.0 + ((ARFCN - 512) * .2) <br> 
Down = Up + 80.0<br><br>

<a name = "msisdn"></a><h2>Mobile Subscriber ISDN (MSISDN)</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MSISDN is the subscriber's phone number. It is the number that another person would dial in order to reach the subscriber. The MSISDN is composed of three parts:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Country Code (CC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Destination Code (NDC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subscriber Number (SN)<br><br><center><img src="images/msisdn.jpg"><h3>MSISDN</h3></center><br><br><b>Country Code (CC)</b> - This is the international dialing code for whichever country the MS is registered to.<br><br><b>National Destination Code (NDC)</b> - In GSM, an NDC is assigned to each PLMN. In many cases, a PLMN may need more than one NDC.<br><br><b>Subscriber Number (SN)</b> - This is a number assigned to the subscriber by the service provider (PLMN).<br><br><br><br>The combination of the NDC and the SN is known as the National (significant) Mobile Number.

It uniquely identifies the subscriber within the GSM global network. The IMSI is burned into the SIM card when the subscriber registers with PLMN service provider. The IMSI is composed of three parts:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile Country Code (MCC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile Network Code (MNC)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile Subscriber Identification Number (MSIN)<br><br><center><img src="images/imsi.jpg"><h3>IMSI</h3></center><br><br><b>Mobile Country Code (MCC)</b> - This number identifies which country the subscriber's network is in.

<a name = "imei"></a><h2>International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IMEI uniquely identifies the Mobile Equipment itself. It is essentially a serial number that is burned into the phone by the manufacturer.

It is composed of 8 digits. Under the new system (as of April 2004), the first two digits of a TAC are the <i>Reporting Body Identifier</i> of the GSMA approved group that allocated this model type.<br><br><b>Serial Number (SNR)</b> - This number is a manufacturer defined serial number for the model of wireless device.<br><br><b>Spare (SP)</b> This number is a check digit known as a <i>Luhn Check Digit</i>. It is omitted during transmission within the GSM network.<br><br>On many devices the IMEI number can be retrieved by entering *#06#<br><br><br><br><h2>Former IMEI Structure</h2>Prior to April, 2004 the IMEI had a different structure:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type Allocation Code (TAC) - 6 digits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final Assembly Code (FAC) - 2 digits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial Number (SNR) - 6 digits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare (SP) - 1 digit<br><br><center><img src="images/imei_fac.jpg"><h3>Former IMEI Structure</h3></center><br><br>As of April 2004, the use of the FAC was no longer required. The current practice is for the TAC for a new model to get approved by national regulating bodies, known as the <i>Reporting Body Identifier</i>.<br><br>
